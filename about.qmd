# At my desk

I'm a product manager working in the technology and learning sectors. I have a special interest in using data science to find new perspectives on the thorny problems at the heart of EdTech. Seeing things differently often leads to new ideas.

I'm currently working for [The Open Universit](http://www.open.ac.uk/)y on a range of innovation projects spanning:

-   Immersive collaboration environments

-   Adaptive and predictive analytics

-   Learning behavioural insight

I mostly work in the early to mid-market identifying new opportunities, evaluating them and using agile methods to turn them into production-ready products and services.

# Away from it

I live in Oxford, UK, and split my time between renovating my house, repairing my camper van and chasing around after my toddler. Back when I had free time I used rock-climb and mountaineer across Europe and North America. Now my knees are tending to prefer mountain biking and backcountry skiing.
