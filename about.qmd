# In work

I\'m a product manager working in the technology and learning sectors. I have a special interest in using data science to find new perspectives on the thorny problems at the heart of EdTech. I'm currently working on a range of innovation projects for [The Open University](http://www.open.ac.uk/)Â in the fields of:

-   Immersive collaboration environments

-   Adaptive and predictive analytics

-   Learning behavioural insight

I mostly work in the early to mid-market identifying new opportunities, evaluating them and using agile methods iteratively explore, test and grow them towards market-fit and introduction into business-as-usual.

If you have an interest in these areas, it would be great to hear from you.

# Outside of work

I live in Oxford, UK, and split my time between renovating my house, repairing my camper van and chasing around after my toddler. Back when I had free time I used rock-climb and mountaineer across Europe and North America. Now my knees are tending to prefer mountain biking and backcountry skiing.
